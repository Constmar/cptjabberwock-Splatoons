* Visual Detection

   * Displays a green 90° front cone on visual detection enemies (excluding the Ahriman type)
   * Displays a green 120° front cone on visual detection enemies (Ahriman type only)
* Proximity Detection
   * Displays a red circle around proximity detection enemies (10m + target hitbox)
* Sound Detection
   * Displays a purple circle around sound detection enemies (10m + target hitbox)

   * Displays a red dot centered on touch detection enemies
   * Touch Detection guidelines below

* Personal notes, etc (Ungeho)
   * A lot of information in Palace of the Dead is missing
   * Palace Beetle's (Visual Detection) detection range is larger than 10m (unmodified) **(May need some tests)**
   * Palace Hippogryph (Proximity Detection) probably has a much wider touch detection range (less than 10m), visual detection (about 10m) left as proximity detection for safety
      * **(From my understanding, the Hippogryph has Visual Detection, but also a bigger hitbox on Touch Detection so Ungeho let it as Proximity for safety if you want to sneak behind it)**
   * About Touch Detection (predictions)
      * The following two types of touch detection are used
        * a. Your hitbox or target ring touches the center of the enemy
        * b. Your hitbox or target ring touches the center of the enemy or the enemy ring
      * Expect most enemies to be using a, some may be using b (unverified)
