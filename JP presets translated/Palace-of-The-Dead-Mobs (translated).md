* Personal notes, etc (Ungeho)
   * A lot of information in Palace of the Dead is missing
   * Palace Beetle's (Visual Detection) detection range is larger than 10m (unmodified) **(Can't understand this well)**
   * Palace Hippogryph (Proximity Detection) probably has a much wider touch detection range (less than 10m), visual detection (about 10m) left as proximity detection for safety **(Can't understand this well)**
   * About Touch Detection (predictions)
      * The following two types of touch detection are used
        * a. Your hitbox or target ring touches the center of the enemy
        * b. Your hitbox or target ring touches the center of the enemy or the enemy ring
      * Expect most enemies to be using a, some may be using b (unverified)
