**To do**
```diff
! Side Swipes, Tankbuster cone and Cross shape
! Iron Splitter (Sand & Tiles) : No way to diffrerentiate using base Splatoon, it would need a script that calculate distance of boss + Avatar castin Iron Splitter from the Center of Arena
! Timing on Blades of Mercy : Resolution have faster cast time than the readyness so it resolve faster than the layout have time to disappear or appear
! Dead Iron (Earthshaker) : find a way to make cones from boss to people with specific VFX on them
! Burning Chains : do I need to explain with a text over your character ?
! Merciful Arc : Tankbuster cleave but not the same as Baleful Onslaught ? Cast Once before first Baleful Swathe

! Optimal Offensive: Shield Omen (Knockback) + Sword Omen (Big Circle AOE) : Aetherial Sphere in center with a charge towards it (Need to make a Line preset so people don't stay in the charge and take a Doom Stack)
! Optimal Play : Shield Omen (Donut) + Sword Omen (Circle) : Need to find a way to target the Blades VFX for a Cone Aoe combined with the Shield or Sword
! Bombslinger & Above Board: Big Bombs drop before small bombs and Players drop like small bombs normally
! Reversal of Forces : Tethered players and/or Bombs will drop first
! Winds of Weight : 2 Wind and 2 Lightning AOE appear : Tethered players need to go wind, not tethered go to Lightning
! Reading + Queen's Shot : Gets an Unseen buff with a 1 open side vfx on you, face Queen's Gunner with open side before Queen's Shot is cast then to the turret on the side of the arena
! Gun Turret : Adds that need to be killed or wipe
! Higher Power : Dispel damage buff in Gun Turrets
! Great Ball of Fire : Summon 4 Fireballs (2 small and 2 big), Draw size of aoe depending on the size of the ball
! Icy/Fiery Portent: Move/Stop Moving when cast : Text
! Double Gambit + Secrets Revealed : Already Works I think
! Aura Sphere casting Fracture : AOE circle with Text for Healer Reflect
! Coat of Arms : maybe see if the spell is different for sides and Front/back so I can put Cones for best angle
